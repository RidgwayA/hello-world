# hello-world
Hello everyone.
I am trying to get back into coding after I took classes on it in college but ended up pursing a diffrent path. I do have a BA in General Business but learning about computers and coding has always been my main interest. I hope to learn more on C# (what I learned in school) and also learn other languages by self teachings. I am currently doing HTML and Python. Thanks for stopping by!
